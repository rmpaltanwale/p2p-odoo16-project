## Background Business Case

This is a supply chain business case for the hypothetical company Banana Inc., a grocery store. From start to finish, this document describes how vendor sourcing, purchasing, product receipt, vendor billing, and supplier payment are implemented in Odoo 16‚Äôs Procure to Pay workflow.

## Goals

The goal of this project is to establish a new workflow for vendor management, purchasing, product receipt, vendor billing, and payment processing to improve the efficiency and accuracy of Banana Inc.‚Äôs procurement operations. Prior to this, the company relied on a fragmented and outdated purchasing system. This implementation will add value by enhancing supplier coordination, streamlining purchase approvals, improving inventory accuracy, and ensuring timely and transparent payments to vendors.
